	abstract = {This work focuses on document fragments association using deep metric learning methods. More precisely, we are interested in ancient papyri fragments that need to be reconstructed prior to their analysis by papyrologists. This is a challenging task to automatize using machine learning algorithms because labeled data is rare, often incomplete, imbalanced and of inconsistent conservation states. However, there is a real need for such software in the papyrology community as the process of reconstructing the papyri by hand is extremely time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we explore ways in which papyrologists can obtain useful matching suggestion on new data using Deep Convolutional Siamese-Networks. We emphasize on low-to-no human intervention for annotating images. We show that the from-scratch self-supervised approach we propose is more effective than using knowledge transfer from a large dataset, the former achieving a top-1 accuracy score of 0.73 on a retrieval task involving 800 fragments.},

After the introduction of a standard benchmark dataset with the 2009 Document Image Binarization Contest, research in the field accelerated. Besides the standard methods for image thresholding, preprocessing, and post-processing, we review the literature on methods such as statistical models, pixel classification with learning algorithms, and parameter tuning. In addition to reviewing binarization algorithms, we discuss the available public datasets and evaluation metrics, including those that require pixel-level ground truth and those that do not. We conclude with recommendations for future work.},

This is evident from the recent Document Image Binarization Competition ({DIBCO} 2019) where we can see researchers from all over the world participated in this competition. In this paper, we present a novel binarization technique which is found to be capable of handling almost all types of degradations without any parameter tuning. Present method is based on an ensemble of three classical clustering algorithms (Fuzzy C-means, K-medoids and K-means++) to group the pixels as foreground or background, after application of a coherent image normalization method. It has been tested on four publicly available datasets, used in {DIBCO} series, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Present method gives promising results for the aforementioned datasets. In addition, this method is the winner of {DIBCO} 2019 competition.},

	isbn = {978-3-030-68787-8},
	abstract = {Document Information Retrieval has attracted researchers' attention when discovering secrets behind ancient manuscripts. To understand such documents, analyzing their layouts and segmenting their relevant features are fundamental tasks. Recent efforts represent unsupervised document segmentation, and its importance in ancient manuscripts has provided a unique opportunity to study the said problem. This paper proposes a novel collaborative deep learning architecture in an unsupervised mode that can generate synthetic data to avoid uncertainties regarding their degradations. Moreover, this approach utilizes the generated distribution to assign labels that are associated with superpixels. The unsupervised trained model is used to segment the page, ornaments, and characters simultaneously. Promising accuracies in the segmentation task were noted. Experiments with data from degraded documents show that the proposed method can synthesize noise-free documents and enhance associations better than the state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate the usage of overall generated samples, and their effectiveness in different unlabelled historical documents tasks.},

	abstract = {In recent years, machine learning and deep learning approaches such as artificial neural networks have gained in popularity for the resolution of automatic puzzle resolution problems. Indeed, these methods are able to extract high-level representations from images, and then can be trained to separate matching image pieces from non-matching ones. These applications have many similarities to the problem of ancient document reconstruction from partially recovered fragments. In this work we present a solution based on a Graph Neural Network, using pairwise patch information to assign labels to edges representing the spatial relationships between pairs. This network classifies the relationship between a source and a target patch as being one of Up, Down, Left, Right or None. By doing so for all edges, our model outputs a new graph representing a reconstruction proposal. Finally, we show that our model is not only able to provide correct classifications at the edge-level, but also to generate partial or full reconstruction graphs from a set of patches.},

We provided three different classification tasks, which can be solved individually or jointly: font group/script type, location, date. The document images are provided by several institutions and are taken from handwritten and printed books as well as from charters. In contrast to previous competitions, all participants relied upon Deep Learning based approaches. Nevertheless, we saw a great performance variety of the different submitted systems. The easiest task seemed to be font group recognition while the script type classification and location classification were more challenging. In the dating task, the best system achieved a mean absolute error of about 22 years.},
